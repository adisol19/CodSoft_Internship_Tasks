        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967), known as the "father of the atomic
          bomb," was a pioneering physicist whose work profoundly shaped modern
          science and global history. As the scientific director of the
          Manhattan Project, he played a central role in the development of
          nuclear weapons during World War II. His remarkable contributions to
          quantum mechanics, theoretical physics, and astrophysics were matched
          by his complex legacy, embodying both the triumphs and dilemmas of
          scientific progress. Julius Robert Oppenheimer was a brilliant
          physicist whose life and career were marked by extraordinary
          achievements and profound ethical questions. His leadership in the
          Manhattan Project, culminating in the first successful nuclear test in
          1945, forever altered the course of warfare and global diplomacy.
          Despite his scientific triumphs, Oppenheimer's later life was defined
          by his opposition to nuclear arms proliferation and his political
          struggles during the Red Scare, which tarnished his career but
          solidified his role as a symbol of scientific responsibility.

        <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Oppenheimer’s contributions shaped modern physics and global
          geopolitics. As a scientist, he advanced our understanding of the
          universe, including quantum mechanics and black hole theory. As a
          leader, his work on the Manhattan Project ended World War II but
          introduced the world to the nuclear age, raising ethical and moral
          debates that persist today. Despite political challenges, including
          the loss of his security clearance during the Red Scare, Oppenheimer
          remains a symbol of scientific brilliance and responsibility. His life
          is a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the weight of its
          consequences.
